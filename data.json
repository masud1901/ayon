        "shortBio": "Machine Learning Researcher | Computer Vision & Deep Learning Enthusiast",
        "fullBio": "I'm a Machine Learning researcher at the Institute of Information Technology, Jahangirnagar University. My journey started with computer vision and deep learning, where I built a strong foundation working on various image processing and neural network projects.\n\nMy early work focused on computer vision tasks and traditional deep learning models. Over time, I became really interested in how we could make better use of unlabeled data, which led me to explore semi-supervised learning. A turning point came when I worked on a quantum graph contrastive learning project for particle physics - this opened my eyes to the amazing possibilities of combining quantum computing with machine learning.\n\nI've worked on some cool projects like:\n• A quantum-classical hybrid system (KACQ-DCNN) for heart disease detection\n• A special type of quantum neural network that helps analyze particle physics data\n• Various computer vision and deep learning models\n\nI'm comfortable working with:\n• Computer Vision & Deep Learning\n• Semi-Supervised Learning\n• Quantum Machine Learning\n• Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Qiskit\n\nOutside of research, I enjoy being part of the student community. I lead the IIT-JU Sports Club and help run communications for our IEEE Student Branch. These roles let me connect with other students and share what I've learned.\n\nWhat really excites me is finding ways to make machine learning work better with less labeled data. I want to build systems that can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data, especially in areas like healthcare and physics where getting labeled data can be really hard."
