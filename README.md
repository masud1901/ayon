## Key Features

- **Elegant & Minimalist Design**: Clean, centered layout with a focus on typography and readability.
- **Fully Responsive**: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Data-Driven Content**: The **Projects** and **Publications** pages are dynamically generated by fetching data from `data.json`. This makes content updates easy and removes the need to edit HTML.
- **Interactive Background**: Features a subtle, animated "neural lightning" background using JavaScript and HTML Canvas.
- **Consistent Theming**: Uses CSS variables for a consistent and easily customizable color scheme.
- **Professional Profile**: A comprehensive "About Me" page that details education, experience, achievements, and research interests.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**:
    - Flexbox & Grid for layout
    - CSS Variables for theming
    - Responsive design with media queries
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**:
    - `fetch` API for loading data from `data.json`
    - DOM manipulation to build project and publication lists
    - Canvas API for the background animation
